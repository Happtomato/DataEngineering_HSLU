# Week 4 — Downloads before class

[All preparation checklists](README.md) · [Week 4 materials](../weeks/04-transformation-and-serving/README.md)

Prepare these files and the Python image before travelling to class. This checklist does not require loading data, writing SQL, or completing the week's exercises.

## 1. Keep the Week 2 environment

Keep Docker, the PostgreSQL and pgAdmin images, your `.env`, and the January taxi file from [Week 2 preparation](week-02.md). Keep the existing database volume too. Do not run `docker compose down -v`: it removes the saved lab database.

If you missed Week 2, complete its downloads checklist now. Week 4 uses at least one complete month from Week 2 Part 3, Step 7. Keep the downloaded January file so that loading it requires no additional download. The loading activity stays in the practical instructions; it is not part of this preparation checklist.

## 2. Get the current course files

Update your course copy using your usual Git workflow, preserving your own changes. Check that it contains:

- `examples/nyc-taxi/load_zones.py`
- `examples/nyc-taxi/sql/week4/01-zones.sql` through `06-check-access.sql`
- `weeks/04-transformation-and-serving/README.md`

The fictional customer and booking records are included in `05-tokenization.sql`; there is no separate customer dataset to download.

## 3. Download the taxi-zone lookup

Download the [official Taxi Zone Lookup CSV](https://d37ci6vzurychx.cloudfront.net/misc/taxi_zone_lookup.csv), linked on the [TLC data page](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page).

Save it as:

```text
examples/nyc-taxi/data/taxi_zone_lookup.csv
```

If your browser displays the CSV, use Save As and preserve the `.csv` extension. Check that the download has finished and the file is not empty. Its first line should contain `LocationID`, `Borough`, `Zone`, and `service_zone`. Do not rename these CSV columns or edit the values.

## 4. Build the updated Python image

Start Docker. Open a terminal in `examples/nyc-taxi`, then run:

```sh
docker compose build ingest
```

This prepares an image containing the new zone loader. It does not start PostgreSQL or load records. The existing dependencies are reused; no new Python package is needed for Week 4.

Check that the script is available without starting the database:

```sh
docker compose run --rm --no-deps ingest load_zones.py --help
```

Expect usage instructions mentioning a file path. `--no-deps` skips dependent services, and `--help` exits before connecting to PostgreSQL.

## Ready-to-attend checklist

- Docker starts and the Week 2 images are available.
- The Week 2 taxi file and the new zone CSV are in `examples/nyc-taxi/data`.
- The updated image built successfully and the help command worked.
- The six Week 4 SQL files are available locally.

No additional cloud account, service, or software installation is required. Recheck this file when a course update is announced.
