# Week 5 — Your first Kestra flow

[Week 5 overview and startup](README.md)

## Goal

Create a small workflow that accepts a year and month and writes them to a log. This introduces inputs, tasks, and executions before we connect the taxi loader. It does not download files or change the database.

**Before starting:** complete the [Kestra startup instructions](README.md) and open its web interface.

## 1. Read the flow

Open [01-taxi-intro.yaml](flows/01-taxi-intro.yaml). This YAML file defines the workflow:

```yaml
id: taxi_intro
namespace: deng.week5

inputs:
  - id: year
    type: INT
    defaults: 2024
  - id: month
    type: INT
    defaults: 1
    min: 1
    max: 12

tasks:
  - id: show_period
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log
    message: "Selected taxi data: year={{ inputs.year }}, month={{ inputs.month }}"
```

| Setting | What it means |
|---|---|
| `id: taxi_intro` | The name identifying our flow within its namespace. |
| `namespace: deng.week5` | Groups our Week 5 flows. It is not a PostgreSQL schema. |
| `inputs` | Values supplied when starting an execution. |
| `type: INT` | The input must be a whole number. |
| `defaults` | The initial value offered when starting a run. |
| `min` and `max` | The allowed range for the month. |
| `tasks` | The steps Kestra will execute. This flow has one task. |
| `id: show_period` | The name of that task. |
| `type: io.kestra.plugin.core.log.Log` | Selects Kestra's built-in task for writing a log message. |
| `{{ inputs.year }}` | Inserts the year supplied for this execution. The month expression works the same way. |

YAML uses indentation to group settings. Preserve the spaces when copying the file; do not replace them with tabs.

**Two rules about IDs:**

1. **IDs must be unique within their scope.** A flow ID must be unique within its namespace: `deng.week5` can contain only one flow named `taxi_intro`, but another namespace can use the same name. Task IDs must be unique within a flow. Running a flow again does not require changing either ID; Kestra generates a separate execution ID for each run.
2. **Saving a flow establishes its identity.** The combination of namespace and flow ID identifies the saved flow, even before its first execution. You can later edit its tasks, inputs, and messages, but to use a different flow ID, copy the YAML into a new flow and change the ID before saving. The original flow keeps its execution history; the new flow has its own history.

## 2. Create the flow in Kestra

1. In the Kestra interface, open **Flows** and choose **Create** or **Create flow**.
2. Open the YAML/source editor if necessary.
3. Replace the example content with the entire contents of `01-taxi-intro.yaml`.
4. Save the flow. You should see `taxi_intro` in the `deng.week5` namespace.

Saving creates the workflow definition. It does not run the task. Editing the file on your laptop also does not automatically update Kestra; save the revised definition in Kestra when you change it.

## 3. Execute it for January

Choose **Execute**, keep `year = 2024` and `month = 1`, and start the execution.

Open the execution and its **Logs** view. Look for the message from `show_period`:

```text
Selected taxi data: year=2024, month=1
```

The task and execution should finish with **SUCCESS**. This confirms the logging task ran; it does not mean taxi data was loaded.

## 4. Run the same flow for February

Start another execution of `taxi_intro`. Set `month = 2`, keeping `year = 2024`. Do not edit the YAML defaults for this step.

Find this message in the new execution's logs:

```text
Selected taxi data: year=2024, month=2
```

Open the execution history and compare both runs. You have one workflow definition and two separate executions, each with its own inputs and log.

## 5. Check an invalid input

Try entering `month = 13`. Check whether Kestra prevents submission or adjusts the value to `12`. If an execution starts, inspect its inputs to see which month was actually submitted. The permitted range is 1–12.

**Discuss:**

1. What is the difference between saving a flow and executing it?
2. Why can one flow process different months without editing its code?
3. Does a successful logging task prove the taxi records exist in PostgreSQL? Explain.

**Finish with:** one saved flow, two successful executions with different month values, and the log message from each. In the next exercise, we will replace the demonstration work with tasks that run and check the taxi pipeline.
