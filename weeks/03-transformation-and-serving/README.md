# Week 3 — Transformation, serving, and protecting identifiers

[Module homepage](../../README.md) · [Downloads before class](../../preparation/week-03.md)

Week 2 made taxi records available in PostgreSQL. This week we make those records useful for a specific question: **How many selected trips started in each pickup zone on each day, and what was their combined fare amount?**

By the end, you should be able to explain an ingestion choice, define a reporting rule, enrich and aggregate data with SQL, and show how an analyst can use customer tokens without reading the original identifiers.

    T[Week 2 taxi records] --> V[Reviewed trips: derived fields and flags]
    Z[Taxi-zone lookup] --> V
    V --> R[Daily report by pickup zone]
    R --> P[Read results in pgAdmin]
```

The source records stay in place. SQL views provide different ways to query them. A **view** is a saved query: PostgreSQL runs its query when you read the view. It does not store a separate copy of the results.

## Session route

Allow about two hours, with extra time if SQL joins and grouping are new.

| Activity | Time | Connection to HS26 SW3 slides* |
|---|---|---|
| Explain the existing ingestion design | 10 min | 3–10: ingestion decisions and CDC |
| Inspect data quality | 20 min | 11–12: make ingested data usable |
| Derive fields and join zone names | 30 min | 12–13: transformations and business rules |
| Build and check a daily report | 20 min | 14–16: consumer and serving |
| Tokenize fictional customer identifiers | 25 min | 21–22: security and least privilege |
| Apply the decisions to your project | 15 min | 20: project architecture |

## 1. Explain what you already built

Draw the Week 2 source, Python loader, PostgreSQL server, and pgAdmin client. Label who requests the file and when records become available.

Discuss with a partner:

- Why is this **batch** ingestion even though Python processes 10,000 records at a time?
- Who initiates the download: the source or our loader?
- Does downloading February tell us which January records were corrected or deleted?
- Could monthly published files support an alert about congestion happening now?

Finish with a sentence explaining **batch + pull + full-file ingestion**. Processing a file in small batches does not turn it into streaming. Loading another month is not change data capture (CDC): our source does not provide individual update and delete events.

## 2. Build the practical results

Follow these in order:

1. [Taxi transformation and reporting](part-1-transformation.md).
2. [Tokenization and access](part-2-tokenization.md).

Use your existing PostgreSQL, pgAdmin, and Python image. No cloud account or new service is required. The report uses `public.taxi_trips_monthly`, loaded in Week 2 Part 3, Step 7. Finish loading at least one month before starting; you can also work with the full year of 2024.

## 3. Apply the decisions to your project

With your project partner, write down:

- **Consumer:** who uses the result, and for what decision?
- **Changes:** three concrete transformations your source needs.
- **Rule:** one definition of a valid record or a metric, with an example.
- **Placement:** what happens before loading, and what happens after loading?
- **Cadence:** how fresh must the result be, and can the source provide that freshness?
- **Access:** which fields should the consumer see, and which should be restricted?

Update your pipeline diagram and explain one trade-off. For example, keeping source records helps you investigate and rebuild a report, but access to sensitive source fields must be restricted.

## Finish with

- A daily report with documented inclusion rules and matching record counts.
- One example of a flagged record, or a statement that your loaded data contained none of that kind.
- A successful token-based query and an expected permission-denied result.
- Your updated project diagram and decisions.
